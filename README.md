# About ME ðŸ‘‹

I'm just starting my journey down the rabbit hole. "After 8 years in the military and another 16 years in law enforcement, I've seen firsthand the importance of protecting people and assets from all kinds of threats. Now, I'm thrilled to be pivoting to a new kind of defense.

â€‹This September, I returned to school to study Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University. My time in law enforcement has given me a deep understanding of human behavior, threat patterns, and the critical importance of a proactive mindsetâ€”all skills I'm excited to apply to the digital world.

â€‹I'm ready to take on this new challenge and contribute my unique perspective to the world of cyber defense. Here's to a new beginning!"
